# Brand Name Options

B2B platform for **wellness**, **adventure**, and **luxury** properties.

## Final Three Candidates

### 1. Escavio (Recommended)

**Etymology:** Invented word, rooted in "escape"

**Pros:**
- Short, brandable, unique
- Neutral across all three verticals
- Full namespace likely available (.com, .io, .co)

|--------|--------|
| escavio.com | Possibly available |
| escavio.io | Possibly available |
| escavio.co | Possibly available |
