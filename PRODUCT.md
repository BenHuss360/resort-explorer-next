# WanderNest Product Overview

## What Is WanderNest?

WanderNest is a GPS-powered exploration platform that transforms how guests discover and experience hospitality properties. Properties create interactive maps with rich content hotspots, and guests explore organically—content unlocks as they walk the grounds.

## The Problem We Solve

**For properties:**
- Static maps and brochures don't capture the richness of a destination
- Guests miss hidden gems because they don't know where to look
- No way to guide exploration without intrusive signage
- Difficult to communicate the full story of special locations

**For guests:**
- Overwhelmed by options, unsure where to start
- Miss interesting spots because they're not marked or obvious
- Want self-guided exploration but lack context
- Desire to discover, not follow a rigid tour

## The WanderNest Solution

An embeddable, browser-based map that makes exploration feel like discovery:

1. **GPS-triggered content** — Information reveals automatically when guests approach hotspots (within 10m)
2. **Rich media experiences** — Audio guides, videos, and detailed descriptions bring locations to life
3. **Zero friction** — No app download required; works in any browser via link or QR code
4. **Offline capable** — Content caches locally for areas with limited connectivity
5. **Privacy-first** — Location data never leaves the guest's device

## Core Features

### For Properties (Portal)
- Upload custom illustrated maps that overlay on satellite imagery
- Create hotspots with text, images, audio, and video
- Customize marker styles and colors per hotspot category
- Generate QR codes and shareable links
- Mobile QR flow for on-location hotspot creation
- Preview exactly what guests will see

### For Guests (Map Experience)
- Interactive map showing all discoverable locations
- Two modes:
  - **Full Mode** — Tap any marker to see content
  - **Interactive Mode** — Content auto-reveals via GPS proximity
- Audio guides that play with one tap
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Works offline after initial load

## How Properties Use It

1. **Sign up** and create a project
2. **Upload a custom map** (optional) — illustrated property maps calibrate to the satellite layer
3. **Add hotspots** — drop pins, add content (photos, audio, descriptions)
4. **Share** — via access code, QR code, direct link, or embed in their app

## Pricing Model (Future)

Freemium with usage tiers:
- **Free** — Up to 5 hotspots, basic features
- **Pro** — Unlimited hotspots, custom branding, analytics
- **Enterprise** — White-label, API access, dedicated support

## Technical Differentiation

- **Browser-native GPS** — Uses the Geolocation API; no native app overhead
- **Smart location mocking** — For demos or when guests are far from the venue, the experience still works
- **Affine transform calibration** — Custom maps align precisely using 2-corner or 3-corner calibration
- **Progressive web capabilities** — Can be added to home screen for app-like experience

## Success Metrics

- Guest engagement time per session
- Hotspot discovery rate (% of hotspots visited)
- Return visits during a guest's stay
- NPS from property managers

## Vision

WanderNest makes every property explorable. We believe the best guest experiences happen through discovery—not instruction. Our platform lets properties tell their story in a way that feels personal and serendipitous, turning every walk into an adventure.
