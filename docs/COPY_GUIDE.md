## Brand Voice

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What it means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Inviting** | We welcome people to explore, never pressure them | "Discover at your own pace" not "Don't miss out!" |
| **Warm** | Friendly and human, not corporate | "Give your guests something to discover" not "Enhance guest engagement metrics" |
| **Confident** | We know the product works, no hedging | "Works offline" not "Can work offline in most cases" |
| **Clear** | Simple language, no jargon | "No app needed" not "Browser-based progressive web application" |
| **Active** | Dynamic verbs, forward momentum | "Explore," "Discover," "Unlock" not "Can be explored" |

### Voice Don'ts

- No corporate buzzwords (leverage, synergy, ecosystem, utilize)
- No superlatives without substance (revolutionary, game-changing, world-class)
- No fear-based marketing (don't miss out, your competitors are...)
- No overpromising (guaranteed, always, never fails)
- No gendered language (guys, he/she—use "they" or "guests")

## Writing for Different Audiences

### Writing for Properties (B2B)

Properties are buying a guest experience tool. Lead with guest benefits, then operational ease.

**Do:**
- Focus on what guests will feel and do
- Mention ease of setup and low maintenance
- Be specific about what's included
- Acknowledge they're busy people

**Example:**
> "Guests arrive, scan a QR code, and start exploring. You upload your map once and add hotspots whenever you like. No technical skills needed."

**Don't:**
- Lead with features or technology
- Use B2B jargon (ROI, KPIs, stakeholders)
- Overpromise on outcomes
- Sound like enterprise software

### Writing for Guests (B2C)

Guests don't care about the product—they care about the experience. Keep it invisible.

**Do:**
- Focus on discovery and exploration
- Use sensory, evocative language
- Keep instructions minimal
- Let the property's content shine

**Example:**
> "Wander the grounds and discover hidden stories along the way."

**Don't:**
- Explain how the technology works
- Use product terminology (hotspots, proximity triggers)
- Sound like an instruction manual
- Get in the way of the property's voice

---

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headlines

- Short and punchy (5-8 words ideal)
- Lead with a verb when possible
- Sentence case, not Title Case

**Good:** "Explore every corner"
**Bad:** "Explore Every Corner Of Your Property With Our Platform"

### Body Copy

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks generously
- Lists are your friend

### CTAs (Calls to Action)

- Action verbs: "Try the demo," "Get started," "Contact us"
- Specific over generic: "See how it works" not "Learn more"
- One primary CTA per section

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for: distances (10m), times (3:12), stats
